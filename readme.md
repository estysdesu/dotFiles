# dotFiles
## Description
Contains dot files, scripts, etc. that make up my system configuration and a `makefile` to keep this repo and my local dot files in sync. Each branch corresponds to a different OS, but my daily driver currently is a mac so thats the default.

## TODO
* syncing linux/mac
* add `mkdir -p` to all symlinks (helps setuping up new systems)
