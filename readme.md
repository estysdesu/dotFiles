# dotFiles
## Description
### General  
The main directory currently consists of just random configs for the software I use.
### bin  
Contains the scripts I add to my path for easy access.
* tmuxColour: not mine, but handing for seeing the tmux colour options
* motd: what I start all my mornings [login] terminal sessions with
* lapHeater: shows select SMU settings, currently CPU temp and fan speed; powermetrics is macOS specific
